## What is this project?  
This is an ANN used to classify the gene descripters of yeast.  
The model is built with Keras using Python.  
## How do I run it?  
To run simply click on the `yeastclassifier.ipynb` file and git will run  
it for you and display all the results. To just view the code,  
click on the `yeastclassifier.py` file, and only the code will be displayed.
